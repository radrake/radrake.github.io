      <body>
        <p>
          These are projects that I personally created without a tutorial. <br/>
          I showcase the kinds of projects I am interested in as well as simple resume projects.

          A project will go here once I decide to add one here!

      <h2>School Projects</h2>
      <body>
        <p>
          These are projects that I worked on for school. <br/>
          I showcase the projects that were loosely defined, where most design choices were in our hands. <br/>

      <h2>Tutorial Projects</h2>
      <body>
        <p>
          These are projects that I created by following a tutorial online. <br/>
          I showcase these so that you can see what kind of things I have been trying to learn.

        <p className="project-head"><Link to="/pokemon">PokeAPI - Pokedex</Link></p>
        <p>
          In this project, I learned how to fetch APIs and got more practice using React hooks. <br/>
          It is a very simple project which lets you scroll through a list of pokemon. <br/>
          I followed this Web Dev Simplified tutorial: <br/>

        <p className="project-head">Navbar (The one used for this website!)</p>
        <p>
          In this project, I learned how to add a navbar to a website and route between pages seemlessly using React Router. <br/>
          React Router has become an essential part of this entire website, even allowing the projects in this page to be showed off with ease! <br/>
