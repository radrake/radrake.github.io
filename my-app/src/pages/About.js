            <h2>Who is Ryan?</h2>
            <p>
              I am a Computer Science student at the University of Arkansas.
              I have lived in Fayetteville, Arkansas my entire life and enjoy being in the Northwest Arkansas area.
              I live at home with my Pomeranian named Sassy, and I have a girlfriend with 3 other pets who I all love.
              I got interested in Computer Science early on in high school after taking a very basic programming class.
              This interest carried on throughout high school, taking all of the classes available and eventually deciding on CS for college.

            <h2>My Computer Science Experience</h2>
            <p>
              The first time I really got experience with computer science was my freshman year of high school.
              I have always been attached to my computer and taking a class where all you do is type at a computer was instantly a hit for me.
              Throughout high school I continued to pursue computer science courses and took all that my school had to offer, including the AP classes.
              I decided to further pursue computer science in college and get a degree to eventually make a career out of this passion.
              Computer science in college was a lot of the same that I had been working with for years for a long time, and slowly became boring in the beginning years of college.
              It was not until my junior year when the classes began getting a little more technical, but still not too exciting.
              By my senior year, my passion for writing code and working on more challenging projects had been rekindled, and I began tackling larger personal projects.
              Now, I am working on this website to learn React and front-end development.
              Additionally, I am beginning to learn AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB so that I am prepared to build my capstone project in the spring semester.
              Working with AWS and React helped me narrow my interests in the computer science field, and I am now very excited for my future in computer science.

            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>
              I am Ryan, I have lived in Fayetteville, AR my entire life and I enjoy computer science.
              My passion for CS began early in high school and I have enjoyed programming since, and am beginning to enjoy it even more as I learn more.
