          Welcome to Ryan Drake's webpage! <br/>
          I am a Senior Computer Science student at the University of Arkansas. <br/>
          I use this website to give more information about myself and practice my web development using React. <br/>
          This entire website was programmed by me, Ryan Drake, in React, using the help of online tutorials and my own programming knowledge. <br/>
          You can navigate my website using the navbar at the top, where you can check out my resume and projects, or return to this homepage. <br/>
